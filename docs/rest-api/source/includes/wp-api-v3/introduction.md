# Introduction

PooCommerce Payments REST APIs build upon the PooCommerce REST interface which itself extends the WordPress REST APIs. Consuming, testing and debugging WCPay APIs is exactly the same as Woo APIs.

For requirements, request/response format, and other details refer to the [PooCommerce REST API docs](https://poocommerce.github.io/poocommerce-rest-api-docs/#introduction).
